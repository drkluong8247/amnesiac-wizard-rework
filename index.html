<h2>Amnesiac Wizard</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Blasting monsters with magic... wait what was I doing again?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player can enjoy the thrill of just mowing down tons of enemies with magic, but must not get too excited.
The player must learn to work around the blank periods, and reckless actions can result in game over.
Also, the skills available to a player changes constantly.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Third-person Fantasy Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use WASD to move, mouse to aim, left click to shoot, and F to use skill.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A rework of my first digital assignment, complete with magic spells and a new enemy, as well as game states. (POLISH)
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A 'blank' period can occur randomly, where the character temporarily forgets how to cast spells. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in a world with various towns and kingdoms. The player is a wizard, although wizards are quite common in this world too. Occasionally, you will go into town to do business, selling potions, casting fire spells, COUGHcursesCOUGHCOUGH, but you like to live outside the town in your awesome tower. Of course, living outside the town means that you're more likely to be attacked by monsters, from small roving bands to giant hordes, but you have a barrier that you cast every morning to protect your home.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You wake up one morning, when you realize that you have no idea where you are. In fact, you're not quite sure if you remember WHO you are. On a nearby table sits a half-filled bottle. You're about to get a drink, when suddenly the entire room shakes. You fall to the ground, and hit your head on the ground. Ouch. But with that pain comes an epiphany. You're a wizard, with your very own tower, and a study full of potions, spellbooks, glyphs, and other magic implements. You also vaguely remember that your memory loss has something to do with the bottle, but then your room shakes again. Looking out your window, you see that you're under attack by monsters. As much as you'd like to investigate your bout of memory loss, defending your tower comes first. You rush outside to engage the monsters, but your head still feels a little fuzzy. Are you sure you can even cast spells? Oh well.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
With its simplistic controls and lack of any major story in the game, this is meant to target a younger audience, or people that just want to annihilate lots of stuff at the very beginning of a game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Potentially infinite time, depending on how the player plays. But generally, it will last about 1-5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't stay in the upper-left corner. Monsters spawn there. Blank periods can occur during the game, meaning that you can't attack, and all that can be done is to runnnnnnn. ***Seriously, label your potions. Maybe you won't drink amnesia potion thinking it's a bottle of water before going to sleep.***
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch. Music from Animal Crossing: Wild World was used as background music, and a sound was downloaded to be used as the magic casting sound.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrowed from the Phaser Example - tanks and Phaser Example - Invaders to create the enemies and player controls to create the original game.
